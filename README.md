## Hello ! 👋 I'm Antoine !  
  
A passionnate and eager to learn web developer from Belgium 🤖  
  
## 🌱 About me    
  
My life changed when I discovered development and programming. As a previous financial auditor and marketer, I decided to invest myself 100% into becoming a developer and never been more happier since then. I'm really looking forwards to keep learning and improving everyday.  
  
I'm currently mainly focusing on **JavaScript** which I love !
